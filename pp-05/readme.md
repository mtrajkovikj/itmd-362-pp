## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53w0c0kwi++bu++hX++++rd++kX
Your Rationale: I think that games are associated with vivid colors, plus a vivid color would attract more attention than a greyed out or mellower color. No particular reason, I just like blue. Also Microsoft, Playstation, Wii also have some shades of blue so that's probably why I associated and picked this color.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32-0s0kovK0i6QKtYBKR-VHJdul
Your Rationale: Basically I picked this palette with a green dominant color because I associate spring mostly with green color. As for the purplish and reddish colors, those remind me of flower colors (lily as an example, etc.).

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=339160k++sJR0ZA+VFs+Xn3+zh2
Your Rationale: I didn't like most of the grouped colors for a this private messaging app and I'd go with 2 colors or even monochromatic but if I had to choose I would pick these colors just because I like them. No particular reason, plus I think they would suit well the messaging app.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1001q0kvHja2ltJNnweV8qMOD7u
Your Rationale: Picked this palette mainly because a ruby gemstone is red and it has the word "ruby" in the name so it should be associated with the red color. Picked different shades so it's not monotonous and white for text or some outlines or accent.
