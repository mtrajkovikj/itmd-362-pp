# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: The phone has an elegant design and it is aesthetically pleasing. It's design is pretty simple, yet very appealing (for me at least) and modernistic, so it grabs my attention. The rounded edges add up to the smooth look. The display is vivid and clear, the layout of the apps looks appealing and makes me want to use the phone.

* Behavioral: It's pretty easy to use and straightforward. The OS itself is very fluid and the transitions of the apps opening/closing are also cool, as well as other visual effects the phone has. It is a little bit large but once I got used to it, I don't want to go back to a smaller display. Also you can do different finger gestures that will do different functions (multi touch for example).

* Reflective: I love this phone and I feel secure when I have it with me (because of the fingerprint scan). Using this phone is more pleasurable to me compared to other phones I've used before.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Pretty straihtforward and easy to use, that will lead to a pleasurable experience.
2. Aesthetically pleasing design, with suitable colors and a modernistic look.
3. It will have one function and execute it well, as it should.
