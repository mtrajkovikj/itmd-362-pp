# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

The text description of the modifications I would make is with colored letters on the alternate images. 
For desktop view I would need to change the navigation bar HTML to add the elements between the two red lines and remove the actual elements. 
I would need to push the HTML part for Twitter, Facebook etc. icons at the bottom as a footer.
Edit the CSS to make the navigation bar expand.
Edit the HTML to display some kind of a better looking weather gadget instead of the current weather display element. 
Maybe change order of the windows order (HTML) and make them expand all across the screen (where the green lines are) - that would be done with the CSS.

For mobile view I would need to change the HTML for all the bottom menu items to group them into one navigation bar (nav element) at the top of the page. The current version of the page displays them at the bottom when you click the "menu" button at the top (and that looks BAD). So either a hamburger menu or a horizontal bar.
Also make the nav bar responsive for mobile screens (CSS).
