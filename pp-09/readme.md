# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. https://wsuwp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/7/2015/08/25-point-usability-checklist-final.pdf
2. http://uxchecklist.github.io/

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. All major parts accessible from the home page.
2. Font size is easy to read.
3. Responsive mobile/touch design.
4. Consistent color palette and font.
5. Related topics are located together (grouped/submenu etc.).
6. Build prototypes and brainstorm.
7. Have meaningful URLs.
8. Have users test the site, give feedback and fix errors accordingly (if needed).
9. Users can return to the home page easily.
10. Main navigation should be easily recognizable.
